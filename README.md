# Blender-Shortcut-Keys
Here is a list of some common shortcut keys for working with Grease Pencil in Blender:

- Shift + A: Add a new drawing
- Shift + S: Save the current drawing
- Shift + O: Toggle Onion Skinning
- Shift + X: Clear all drawings
- Shift + D: Duplicate the current drawing
- Shift + LMB: Select multiple strokes
- Shift + C: Clear the selection
- Ctrl + Z: Undo
- Ctrl + Shift + Z: Redo
- Ctrl + S: Save the blend file

To move from the 2D View to the 3D View in Blender using a shortcut, you can press the Tab key. This will toggle between Edit Mode and Object Mode in the 3D View.

Alternatively, you can use the Numpad . key to move the camera to the selected object. This can be useful if you are working in the 2D View and want to quickly switch to the 3D View to see how your object looks in 3D space.

You can also use the Shift + Spacebar shortcut to switch between the various workspace layouts in Blender. This can be a convenient way to access the 3D View if it is not already visible.
